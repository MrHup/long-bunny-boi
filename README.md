# long-bunny-boi
An android game I did to experiment with AdMob and other Gideros features.

The game is available on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hupspace.longbunnyboi

## Concept

The idea is similar to the popular game _Flappy Bird_ yet it used a different mechanic I came up with to deal with the jumps. Instead of simply tap jumping over the obtacles, in this application you have to stretch the rubber character long enough to create sufficient force to pass over the facing obstacle.

As for the premise, the game goes on forever with increasing difficulty and you have to keep dodging the obstacles in the scope of achieving a high score.
